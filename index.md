## 📖 Overview
This repository contains end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) implementations completed as part of the CampusX NLP YouTube Playlist. All concepts are implemented with a hands-on, code-from-scratch approach, focusing on practical understanding rather than black-box usage. This guide will help you download and run the software simply and clearly.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To start learning about NLP, follow these steps. You will download the code and run it on your computer without needing any programming experience.

### 💻 System Requirements
- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Python version: 3.6 or higher
- Processor: Minimum dual-core CPU
- RAM: At least 4 GB

### 📦 Tools Needed
You will need to install the following tools:
1. **Python**: This is the programming language used. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Git**: This tool helps you download the code. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. **An IDE or Text Editor**: Software like VSCode or PyCharm will help you run the code. Choose one you feel comfortable with.

## 📬 Download & Install
1. Visit the releases page: [Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-Hands-on-Code-from-Scratch Releases](https://github.com/aphSam/Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-Hands-on-Code-from-Scratch/releases).
2. You will see a list of available versions.
3. Select the latest release version, usually marked as "latest".
4. Download the ZIP file or the individual code files.

After the download:
- Unzip the downloaded folder if you received a ZIP file.
- Navigate into the folder to find the Python files and notebooks.

## 🔍 Running the Code
1. Open your IDE or text editor.
2. Load the main Python script or Jupyter Notebook.
   - If using Jupyter Notebook, you may need to install Jupyter using the command `pip install notebook`.
3. Follow the comments and instructions in the code. Each section explains what it does.

### 📊 Example Implementations
You will find implementations for:
- Text classification
- Sentiment analysis
- Named entity recognition

These examples will help you understand NLP concepts through practical exercises.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting Common Issues
If you encounter issues, here are some common solutions:
- **Python Not Found**: Make sure that Python is included in your system's PATH during installation.
- **Missing Libraries**: You might need to install additional libraries. Use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the code directory to install what you need.
